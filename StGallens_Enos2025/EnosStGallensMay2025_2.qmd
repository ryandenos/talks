Overview
Many theories of social and political behavior (explicitly or implicitly) implicate geographic context, implicating the environment in which the behavior occurs or the people that fill that environment.

In modern social science, we have amazing measures of individual behavior.

Our measures of context are relatively crude: often relying on aggregate summaries (and sometimes small samples) that bring imprecision and possible bias.

---

Wide and Deep Geographic Data
Data that is wide and deep overcomes these limitations.

Wide:

Geographically: 200 million American voters

Temporally: Over 10 years of continuous panel

Deep:

Contains socio-politically important behavioral variables

Connect with other data for more behaviors

Important Preliminary
Important to recognize that not everyone has access to this sort of data...

A springboard for discussion with analogous data (registry data in Scandinavia, cell phone locations, etc.).

Data innovation has to start somewhere (see limited scope of nationally representative survey data circa 1960).

Always looking for collaborators.

Data: Voterfile Example
   
```{r table_ex, include=FALSE}
    
name = c("Ryan Enos", "Ray Dutch", "Theda Skocpol", rep('.', 3))
address = c("1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge", "1 City Hall Sq, Boston", "333 Washington St, Brookline", rep('.', 3))
party = c("D", "R", "D", rep('.', 3))
gender = c("M", "M", "F", rep('.', 3))
race = c("white", "white", "white", rep('.', 3))

voterfile = tibble(name, address, party, gender, race)

voterfile %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_minimal("hover") %>%
  kable_styling(font_size=14)
```

States collect data from every registered person.

Commercial vendors collect state data and repackage it for use by campaigns and other interested parties.

Typically about 200 million voters × 300 variables:

Precise name, address, age, gender, voter turnout

Recorded or imputed race and political party

Hundreds of other variables

## Spatially-weighted Exposure

Every voter is exposed to their 1,000 nearest neighbors.

## Summarize Exposure

Weighted exposure summarized for any arbitrary geography.

## The United States is Highly Segregated

---

## Relative Exposure

Partisans are segregated even at very low levels of aggregation.

- **Relative Exposure:**  
  Within geography:  
  \( sE_{D,R} - sE_{R,R} \) and \( sE_{R,D} - sE_{D,D} \)

## Drivers of Change

Most increases in segregation are driven by:

- Party switching
- Generational replacement
- New voters

## Parting Thoughts

1. Big data can enhance understanding of socio-political behavior.
2. Limitations: data US-based and residential.
3. Future risks to data availability without institutional support.
