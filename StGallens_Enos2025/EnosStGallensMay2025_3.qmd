## Overview {.bg_allport .white-text .white-title}


  
1. Many (I mean *many*!) theories of social and political behavior (explicitly or implicitly) implicate geographic contextual, implicating the environment in which the behavior occurs or the people that fill that environment.

::: {.fragment}
2. In modern social science, we have amazing measures of individual behavior.
:::
  
::: {.fragment}
3. Our measures of context are relatively crude: often relying on aggregate summaries (and sometimes small samples) that bring imprecision and possible bias.

## Wide and Deep Geographic Data {.chicago_background .white-text .white-title .my-bold}
  
  *Data that is wide and deep overcomes these limitations.* 
  
::: {.fragment}
1. **Wide:**
- geographically: 200million American voters
- temporally: over 10 years of continuous panel (or longer)
:::
  
::: {.fragment}
2. **Deep:**
- contains socio-politically important behavioral variables
- connect with other data for more behaviors
:::

  ## Talk Today
  
  1. Overview of data
2. Measurement (studies 1 and 2)
3. Context as an outcome (study 3)
4. Context as a cause (study 4)
5. Connecting with other data (studies 5--10)

- Each study will offer enough background and results to grasp main point and level critiques.  
- *Ultimately, hope to demonstrate fruitful application of approach allowing for new insights on the powerful influence of geographic context on behavior.*

  ## Important Preliminary
  
  *Important to recognize that not everyone has access to this sort of data...*
  
  1. A spring board for discussion with analogous data ("registry" data in Scandinavia, cell phone locations, etc.)...
2. Data innovation has to start somewhere (see limited scope of nationally representative survey data circa 1960).
3. I'm always looking for collaborators...

### Data:
Primary data in studies is U.S. nationwide **voterfile**

```{r voterfile_exampel}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

name = c("Ryan Enos", "Ray Dutch","Theda Skocpol",rep('.',3))
address = c("1737 Cambridge Street, Cambridge, MA", "1 City Hall Square, Boston, MA","333 Washington St, Brookline, MA",rep('.',3))
party = c("D","R","D",rep('.',3))
gender = c("M","M","F",rep('.',3))
race = c("white","white","white",rep('.',3))

voterfile = tibble(name,address,party, gender, race)

voterfile%>%
  kbl(digits =2)%>%
  kable_minimal("hover")%>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 14)
```

- **States** collect data from every **registered** person.
- Commercial vendors collect state data and repackage it for use by campaigns and other interested parties. 
- Typically about **200million voters x 300 variables**
   - Precise name, address, age, gender, and voter turnout 
  - Recored or imputed (see Brown and Enos 2021, Enos 2016) race and political party
  - **Hundreds of other variables**

  ### Parting Thoughts...
  1. Hope I've made the case that this data can significantly enhance our understanding of socio-political behavior.

::: {.fragment}
2. Limitation: all this research is based in U.S. and based on residential location (rather than other places people can be found).
:::

::: {.fragment}
3. Unlike many forms of data, say experimental and surveys, big geographic data requires an institution (other than a university) -- I fear we might soon see a pulling-back of the availability of this data.
